# 📁 Digital Products Local Storage Setup

## 🎯 **No Firebase Required!**

This system stores your digital products locally without any external services or subscriptions.

## 📂 **Directory Structure (Already Created)**

```
public/
└── digital-products/
    ├── pdf/           ← Place PDF files here
    ├── audio/         ← Place MP3 files here
    ├── interactive/   ← Place HTML/ZIP files here
    └── image/         ← Place JPG/PNG files here
```

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Register Products**
- Use the ProductUploadManager component
- Fill in product details (ID, title, price, etc.)
- "Upload" registers the product in localStorage

### **2. Place Files Manually**
- After registration, you'll get the exact file path
- Copy your actual file to that location in the `public` folder
- Example: `public/digital-products/pdf/ecg-quick-ref-123456789.pdf`

### **3. Downloads Work Automatically**
- Files are served directly from your public folder
- Fast downloads (no external API calls)
- Works offline once files are cached

## 💡 **Benefits of Local Storage**

✅ **No Firebase costs** - Completely free  
✅ **No subscriptions** - No ongoing fees  
✅ **Fast downloads** - Direct file serving  
✅ **Play Store safe** - No external dependencies  
✅ **Offline capable** - Files cached locally

        console.log(`Product ${id} registered at ${filePath}`);
      }}
