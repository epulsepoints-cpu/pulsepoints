        options: [
          "Start beta-blocker therapy immediately",
          "Recommend caffeine reduction and lifestyle modification",
          "Order immediate cardiac catheterization",

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "‚úÖ Perfect! In a young, healthy patient with isolated PACs clearly related to excessive caffeine intake, the best initial approach is caffeine reduction and lifestyle modification. This addresses the trigger directly and avoids unnecessary medications in a benign condition."},

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "üéØ Excellent analysis! This shows PACs with aberrant conduction. The key clues are: 1) Early beats with preceding abnormal P waves, 2) Wide QRS due to bundle branch refractoriness, 3) Irregular pattern typical of PACs, 4) Normal QRS in some PACs. Aberrant conduction occurs when PACs arrive early and find conduction system still refractory."},

        explanation: "ü©∫ Outstanding clinical thinking! In a heart failure patient with frequent multifocal PACs and worsening symptoms, the priority is trigger evaluation and heart failure optimization. Frequent PACs in heart failure may indicate: 1) Worsening heart failure, 2) Electrolyte imbalances, 3) Medication effects, 4) Potential progression to atrial arrhythmias.
